		<p class="prayer">
			O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love
with all who love him and obey his commands, we have sinned and
done wrong. We have been wicked and have rebelled; we have turned
away from your commands and laws. We have not listened to your
direction. Now, O Lord our God, hear the prayers and petitions of your
servants. For your sake, O Lord, look with favor on your people. Give ear
and hear; open your eyes and see the desolation of our day. Stop the
spread of this virus, let the truth be told and all deception exposed. We
do not make requests because we are righteous, but because of your
great mercy. O Lord, listen! O Lord, forgive! O Lord, hear and act! For your
sake, do not delay, because your people bear your name.
In Jesus name we pray.
